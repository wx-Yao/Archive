# What is it

I'm easy to be attracted (or sometimes have to be) by different technologies and usually managed to achieve a little bit in various fields, even though I may even use them only once in my life. And these processes yield legacy projects, which are of small values in common sense but actually prove that I've been involved in these interesting fields once. So I'd like some way to keep track of my tech history. I've attempted to use separate repo for different projects, but that would just ruin my repo list. Hence, this repo is my last resort. I'll put those ... nice-to-have-but-not-very-useful stuff in this repo as my archive.

This is also a place for demonstrating the portfolio. I may not be an expert in those fields but I do know what I was doing and of course, the methodologies, which is more valuable than actual skills IMHO.

The codes are not guaranteed to run unless you settle the dependencies (database, server, dataset etc depends on the nature of the project). Also, some codes are not very well written especially when I was still a newbie years ago. Don't expect too much.

# List

Short description of each project (organized in directory). Refer to specific directory for further description.

- ArticleInsight. Full stack web application written in NodeJS & Mongodb & jQuery. It was an university assignment back in 06/2019.

- SVM for classifying Chars74K images. Using Support Vector Machine to classify alphanumeric characters with HOG. It was an university assignment back in 06/2019 and might be my last memory of machine learning stuff lol.

- [Skynet](https://github.com/wx-Yao/Archive/tree/master/skynet). An interesting project that simulates (simplified) the real world bot net in master-slave communication model, which is capable of sending messages peer-to-peer, master bot signing files and slave bots reading files with public key infrastructure. The purpose was to understand and implement cryptographically secure communication in a high-level view. This was an university assignment back in 05/2017.

- [Jsert](https://github.com/wx-Yao/Archive/tree/master/Jsert). A simple tool that adds a blank page after each page in a PDF. It enables to print single-paged PDF when a print couldn't be configured to do so.
